Especially when they are not cached.
A better way for accessing type members is to create delegates, with them the access speed is on pair with direct access.
Harmony created a helper class AccessTools for those cases and BUTR created an extended version of it.
In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll show how you can speed up your code.
Caching Always cache the reflection if it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be called multiple times.</description></item><item><title>Type Wrapping</title><link>https://butr.github.io/documentation/advanced/type-wrapping/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 17:57:01 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://butr.github.io/documentation/advanced/type-wrapping/</guid><description>Introduction Our BUTR mods have a famous history of backwards compatibility.
We use several techniques to achieve this without causing huge performance drops by using Harmony&amp;rsquo;s built in reflection tools and caching.
One of the techniques we use is type wrapping.
It&amp;rsquo;s used for several cases:
When types are moved between assemblies. Generally, to fix this you need to recompile your mod with the new locations, but it won&amp;rsquo;t be backwards compatible this way.</description></item></channel></rss>
