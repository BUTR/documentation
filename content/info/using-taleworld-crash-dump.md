## Introduction
TaleWorlds have their own Crash Reporing mechanism that we modders can use! It provides less info for us, but it's better than nothing.  
If ButterLib or Better Exception Window doesn't generate their Crash Reports, we recommend sending the TW dump files.  

## How to Get a Dump
The game creates a dump file at `C:\ProgramData\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\crashes` after agreeing with the game prompt to send to the developers the crash report.

After an UI with the file list will be shown, you don't need to interact with the interface.  
Go to `C:\ProgramData\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\crashes`. There will be a folder with a name similar to `2022-11-02_08.55.12`. Open it and find a file called `dump.dmp`.

The dump file is fairly big, so we strongly recommend archiving it (zipping) before sending.  
  
Find a free file hosting like [MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/)Â and upload the archive. Post the link and we should be able to help!  
Thanks!
